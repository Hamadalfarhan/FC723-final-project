# FC723 Project â€“ Seat Booking Application 

# This application simulates a seat booking system for Apache Airlines.

# It provides a menu for checking seat availability, booking a seat, freeing a seat, showing booking status, and exiting the program.

# The seating chart simulates a plane with 80 rows, an aisle inserted between seats C and D,
